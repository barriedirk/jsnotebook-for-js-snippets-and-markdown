This is a course I followed from [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-and-typescript-build-a-portfolio-project/)

Where you can build an notebook app where you can execute js snippets online in your browser like codepen and add markdown notes and group them into a file. 

The notebook is saved in your machine in a file using express and node.

The technology used are node, express, react and lerna to manipulate them as a monorepos and publish them into npm packages

Two ways to execute this project

### execute it via npm packages

The package is located on [https://www.npmjs.com/package/notebook-app-inline-markdown-jscode-snippets](https://www.npmjs.com/package/notebook-app-inline-markdown-jscode-snippets)



```shell

# using npx

$ npx notebook-app-inline-markdown-jscode-snippets@latest serve

Opened "file-list-notebooks-workbook.json".

 Navigate to:

http://localhost:4005/

In this folder, the app will create some json files, one it's the list of the notebooks and the other is the notebook code/text

```
